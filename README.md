# Predicting Bug Resolution Time

This project explores whether historical bug metadata can be used to estimate how long a bug will take to be resolved.

Using structured attributes such as priority, severity, component, and assignee, the goal is to build a baseline ML model that predicts bug resolution time (or classifies bugs by expected resolution speed) and to analyze the limits of such predictions in a noisy, real-world setting.
